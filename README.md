Hihi ! 
I'm sevvu, but I mainly go by sev / skull (only for certain occasions).
I use any pronouns except neos, basically just they/he/she. I don't mind which one you use on me, as the way I portray myself online has no effect on my irl self.

Feel free to int if ur silly :3. I don't take things seriously often and tend to joke about situations for comedic relief. Don't fret though! I may be bad at comforting but I'm always there if you need a quick laugh to cheer you up :)

this is mainly for ponytown, so if you want the b4i or dni list please head to the links on the left <3

- ps, ik adamil is a controversial ship, and i'm closely sarcastic when i say i dislike you if you don't like it. However I personally love the ship and Imo i don't see how it's toxic. But, if you don't like the ship then you can simply not interact :D
